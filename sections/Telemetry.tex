The SORA 3 mission


\subsubsection{Uplink}

SORA 3 utilized the three uplink commands shown in Table \ref{tab:Uplink-Commands}.
\begin{table}[h!] 
  \caption{Uplink commands for the SORA 3 mission.}
  \label{tab:Uplink-Commands}
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Y Y Y}
    \hline
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{Command} &
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{Command Byte \num{1}} &
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{Command Byte \num{2}} \\
    \hline
    Activate astrobiology system & 0x11 & 0x12  \\
    Deactivate astrobiology system & 0x21 & 0x22  \\
    Reboot SOCRATES & 0x31 & 0x32 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}
The purpose of the chosen commands was to provide broad control over payload systems that would be able to resolve any issues that would crop up during flight.
The command to reboot SOCRATES would absolve any issues with the sensor data collection, and the astrobiology system could be manually rebooted by executing the other two commands.
If there were any issues with the flight computer (e.g. downlink connection was lost), the HASP power cycle command would be used since an issue with the flight computer would inherently halt all payload operations.

\subsubsection{Downlink}

The data downlink consisted of all sensor data.
The structure of the data packets was as follows:

\noindent\textit{packet-num, rpi-temp, timepix1-temp, timepix1-dose, timepix1-counts, timepix2-temp, timepix2-dose, timepix2-counts, ambient-pressure, iss-pressure, iss-temp, cell1-temp, cell2-temp, cell3-temp, cell4-temp, cell5-temp, cell6-temp, cell7-temp, cell8-temp, photodiode1, photodiode2, photodiode3, photodiode4, timestamp}.


Listing \ref{list:Downlink} shows an example of some downlink packets received during flight.
