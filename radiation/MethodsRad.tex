This is the Medipix sensor methods.

The work of the first two SORA experiments \cite{SORA1} \cite{SORA2} established a strong foundation for the radiation dosimetry portion of the experiment.
Software was developed that enabled our flight computer to control our radiation sensor and analyze its data in real time.
This software was adapted for the SORA 3 mission to accommodate an additional radiation sensor.
This allowed us to put one sensor in the ISS module as well as a control sensor that is comparable to the previous experiments.

%SORA 3 had the addition of a new organic solar cell experiment which
